## SLIDE 2: THE OPPORTUNITY

### Atlantic Canada's businesses are ready for AI. They just need the right moment to start.

- 93% of SMBs say they want to adopt AI but don't know where to begin (Microsoft 2024 Work Trend Index)
- Atlantic Canada has 90,000+ small and medium businesses — the backbone of the regional economy
- There is no flagship AI event in the region focused on business owners (not developers)
- The Atlantic AI Hackathon fills that gap: practical, hands-on, results-driven

**This is the first event of its kind in Atlantic Canada.**

---

## SLIDE 3: PROVEN TRACK RECORD

## HEADLINE

**THE ATLANTIC AI HACKATHON**
Build a real tool for your business in one day. No coding required.

## SUBHEADLINE

Join 100+ business owners and their teams for Atlantic Canada's biggest AI build day. Walk in with a problem. Walk out with a working solution.

## THE PITCH (Landing Page Body)

### What if you could build the tool your business has always needed — in a single day?

Every business has that one thing: the spreadsheet that's held together with duct tape, the manual process that eats 10 hours a week, the customer experience that could be so much better.

The Atlantic AI Hackathon is a full-day event where you and your team use cutting-edge AI tools to build a real, working prototype that solves a real problem in your business. No coding required. No tech experience needed. Just bring the problem — we'll give you the tools and the support to solve it.

### HOW IT WORKS

**1. Choose Your Track**
Pick the challenge that matches your biggest business need:
- Automate What's Eating Your Time
- Build Your Customer Experience
- See Your Business Clearly
- Sell Smarter
- The Wildcard — Fix What's Broken

**2. Get Equipped**
Every participant gets free access to world-class AI building tools (Lovable, v0, Claude Code, and more), a guided walkthrough to get started, and expert mentors by your side all day.

**3. Build**
You have 6+ hours to bring your idea to life. Work solo or with your team. Mentors are available throughout. Checkpoint demos keep the energy high.

**4. Demo & Win**
Show what you built on the main stage. Judges and audience vote. Walk away with prizes, connections, and a tool you can actually use on Monday.

### WHO THIS IS FOR

- **Business owners** who want to use AI but don't know where to start
- **Operations managers** drowning in manual processes
- **Marketing & sales teams** who want smarter tools
- **Anyone in an SMB** who has a problem they wish technology could solve

You do NOT need to be technical. You do NOT need to code. You just need to show up with an open mind and a real business challenge.

### WHAT YOU GET

- Full-day access to AI building tools (hundreds of dollars in credits — free)
- Expert mentors and AI coaches throughout the day
